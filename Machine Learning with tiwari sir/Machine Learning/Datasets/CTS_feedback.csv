Learning opportunities.
MNC infrastructure facilities.
Onsite opportunities.",Not much as of now.,,5,Current Employee,Programmer Analyst,Calcutta,5,3,5,5,3
14-Mar-16,"I joined Cognizant in August, 2015 as a fresher and fortunately, I am going to leave it in few days. There are not much pros. After thinking hard, I was able to come across with few of them.
1. If you do not want to work much or stretch yourself, this is a place for you. It is a relaxed kind of job for freshers like any government job
2. Basic amenities and infrastructure of any location are very good.","1. It is often tough for a fresher to get his/her first project after the completion of training. 50% of them remain in bench for a lond period of time which does not count to their professional experience much.
2. Even if some freshers get deployed into project immediately after the training (the lucky ones), they may get maintenance work, ticketing etc. which is a sheer waste of their talent. Only around 20% of the people ( who are deployed into the project) get some good work like that of a developer. Hence, we see that around 10% of the freshers manage to get some good stuff.
3. Salary is very bad for the freshers. Hike is also extremely poor.
4. Unlike other IT companies like Infosys, low level management is extremely bad. There will be absolutely no one to guide you if you want some kind of help. They do not care about freshers. Many a times, it is like you are on your own. 
5. Bad training. Seriously, their only aim is to anyhow complete the training.
6. Deployment of freshers into the project is completey random. A guy who is not much technically sound can get a very good project while the deserving guys may get the bench.
7. In terms of transparency is absolutely 0.","Lots of. I am listing only few of them. First of all, respect your freshers. Make the system little transparent. Apply some kind of meritocracy instead of random and haphazard process for the selection of freshers in the project.",5,Current Employee,Programmer Analyst Trainee,Bangalore,5,2,2,2,1

21-Apr-20,"I joined Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) in the senior management role - 5 years back. 
Chanced to work across multiple locations and assignments.

: Coming from another product and services MNC to CTS, I could feel that the support system for employees is quite better, be it accommodation, cab facilities, logistical (travel, relocation) aspects
Most of the leadership are comparatively more tech-savvy, technically sound and are capable of doing hands-on work. I was surprised to see this initially but started following the same practices over the period in time!
Developers (rather the non-managers, working on the ground) get opportunity to work on latest technologies.
Happy to see the management is full of architects turned into managers, hence have deeper insight into technical aspects.
CTS is recognized for pitching in as an implementing partner (not to confuse with ERP, but any solution in general) for most of the clients, and does the hands-on, on-the-ground work. 
True to its tagline Keep challenging - CTS gets many challenging assignments
Icing on the cake is the onsite (especially US), opportunities, someone gone out can happily opt to either stay there or come back!",": While the managers and leaders are tech-savvy they lack the vision - be it for the company or for their client. 
It was heartening to see that irrespective of their designation (say VP, AVP, directors) the CTS guys bend in front of client and obey the orders, even though they are capable of advising the client on key decisions.
Organization structure - too many horizontals and verticals with unnecessary hierarchy built-in is the one thing screwing up CTS big time. While it was heard that some c2020 mission etc will streamline this mess-up, but I could not see much changes till I left.
Last but not the least is the heavy regional and language bias. (Unbelievable but true; employees from certain part of India talk in their local language even in meetings and over the conference calls. This is supported duly by their bosses and super bosses. Anyone other than this regional group have to cope with it.
Another simple way to understand this is to see the org tree ( through skype or any other internal portal) you can find that beyond certain level (say Director and above) the top positions are held by people from certain region in India!. Needless to say this impacting the overall working culture and policies and resulting in favoritism, biasing, discrimination and promotions!.
This is a serious advice to any one planning to join at the senior level (senior manager and above). However if you are at the junior level this may not impact you much till you get promoted to next levels","Advice to leadership
All your 'smart looking', 'nicely talking' and 'revenue hungry' leaders seriously lack the vision. They are not capable of going beyond day to day business and meeting quarterly targets. Realize that many of them have been put there owing to favoritism. 
Added to this the messed up organization structure of horizontals verticals is creating huge divide among the teams.
I wont talk mention about compensation etc, unless the above points are not considered you will not be able to run the show successfully!",3,Former Employee,Associate Director,Chennai,3,2,3,2,2

19-Apr-20,1. You come across many excellent colleagues who go above and beyond than what this organization does.,"1. Individual departments/verticals/horizontals being their own PnL centers, the hiring is upto the demand and urgency of requirement. Hence, there is lot of favoritism, nepotism and all that (one or more of relation, community, caste etc.)
2. The new CEO is trying to steer the ship since the last debacle which saw almost all of the senior executives leave the company. Since then, the company hasn't been that good from an employee's perspective (promotions were stalled in '19, hikes were drastically reduced with the promise to make up for it in '20, which now seems improbably with Covid-19.
3. Open forums have somehow been successful in missing core employee issues altogether.
4. The middle layer (AD and above) has become a very fat layer, due to aggressive and mindless hiring when there's a need, which has resulted in inefficiency and lack of professional skills in programs, in turn, causing ripple effect downstream and causing brilliant folks to leave or take a step back and not work to their potential.
5. Promotions - Largely based on affinity to your supervisor and those above them. Regardless of how well one does in projects and excellent client recommendations, additional revenue being brought in by individual consultants, end of the day, there are non-value adding reasons shared, after which one just tends to conclude that it's not worth the hassle. 
6. There is a lack of faith in the new leadership, cos it's new and also that the measures have largely been reducing cost (through more employee effort, reducing benefits etc.) than organic growth and profitability of the company.","1. Identify the good employees at all levels, retain them, nurture them and utilise them for self and company's growth and benefit. It'll surely be a win-win situation.

The hikes here are the worst part. I couldn't reveal the numbers because it's even shameful for me to admit to those hike. Politics been played in every corner of the office.

Rest, nothing. Please refer to con sections","Where to begin is the question. 

- Transparecy- the first thing cognizant has in its vision, mission and ethics crap is Transparecy. This is a pure joke. They are more of opaque, not even translucent. They should remove these clauses, if they are not sticking to it. 

- Retention: this is one funny part. Cognizant has lost and are losing alot of projects. They have so many freshers employees on bench let alone in one city I have seen so many. And they are hiring new people instead of cross training or allocating the projects to their existing employees. Like what is happening !!!

- Senior Leadership : Cognizant promotes/hires those people who themselves needs help mentally and are scared to talk to their seniors. Like one job role you have is to be a moderator between the upper management and your reportee, if you are unable to do that then quit the job and stop ruining others mental health. 
Plus , the new CEO is as pathetic as he looks like . (Not face shaming).

- Poor HR: HR in this company has no brains of themselves. They are here to dress nicely and organize extremely irrelevant events at times. And then they say there is no profit and all crap.

- Benefits/ Amenities: oh God! This is also funny section. They are not good payers at all and the amount of work they make their employees do will one day put the employees into some asylum.

Rest, as I mentioned there except for the Pros everything is a con. Cognizant itself is becoming a con. I don't know if it will survive in future the way it used to be.","Change your CEO !!!

To Senior Leadership: be a leader, atleast try setting an example and if you can't do the job then don't take up that post . You are ruining other lives and that guilt is beyond any other. 
To HR: Please utilize your time and brains in productive things and actually helping out the employees of the company.

28-Dec-19,"Yes I would want to work at Cognizant but with a more active management. People should be encouraged and allowed to work on new things after he or she has put sufficient time and efort in project without any growth opportunities. I was hardly allowed to pursue skills of my choice which were not completely different from the current skill set. For example if I did reporting for 2 years, I expressed interest in learning ETL which was not allowed even though it was there as part of all the projects.i guess nearly 20 members out of 25 were disgusted with the way the resources were not taken care to enhance their technical skills and were made to work in the same project with the same skill set for 4 years literally without scope to see and learn other projects. They put us in a locked ODC without access to any other projects and skill sets. Some poor managers made the situation even worse with their lack of project awareness and ability to encourage the resources to make it to next level.",Ineffective managers and inactive HR who do not take prompt action when a resource comes out with some suggestions or aspirations which led to high attrition. Most of my team mates had to leave cognizant because of lack of job rotation and inability of managers to motivate resources in such melancholic work environment which was locked within an ODC with no access to other projects and skill sets. Lot of politics initiated from the managers much so because they don't have much to offer in terms of work. They are poorly aware of technology and not great in terms of people management as well but some how got those positions because they spent 15 years in the same office and same seat. It has nothing to do with their ability or performance or attitude. No team activity initiated by managers or HR. There are some projects which go so hard on employees and I must say it's again because of the poor quality of managers who fail to understand the pulse of a resource and the project in itself.,It definitely has great potential as an organization but to achieve full potential they have to get rid of inactive managers and HR. Most of them practice and believe in comfort zones. Some of them are too tight when it comes to management. Need change!,3,Current Employee,Programmer Analyst,Hyderābād,3,2,3,3,3

1. Unless you claim your LTA every year, it is not automatically paid at the end of the year payslip although it is part of annual package, has to be closed every FY. The LTA component will be accumulated for years till you realize and withdraw, and till then CTS will make lots of money on the accumulated interest. And when you withdraw with valid travel proofs it will be rejected on some ground and it will be a taxed component. 
2. Worst of the worst company won't do what CTS does now. If you resign your PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE is ZERO. You have to be an active payroll employee to get this part. I resigned in November end and got release in December 2019. I served from Jan to Dec 2019 for FY 2019 but my bonus is ZERO. So you have to wait till you get your bonus in March and then resign immediately.

10-Sep-19,"Important pros - Cognizant gives employees a good flexibility. The freshers learn much quicker here because they are exposed to the customer well and they also learn leadership qualities as they are required to drive the deliveries by themselves. The skill-sets are well preserved under the horizontals, cross-skill and up-skill are well encouraged and easily available. The resource assignment makes sure 100% bandwidth of the employees is utilized, meaning you are very unlikely to get free time while you are at work, which is good for learning.

Some other pros - The dress code policy allows business casuals all days in a week which I believe is very important in a country like India where there are many hot cities. Cab pickup/drop service is provided to those who are not on regular shift and it is free. The company is spread across India, so we can just work from any convenient location if the project or bench ODC is available. HR team regularly conducts fun events and stuffs frequently in major city branches. 

Overall a nice play to work and learn.","Not much opportunities for the experienced employees (Manager and above) with niche skill, they should be open to switch between any role to avoid being on the bench. Employees at on-site are dumped with so much of relevant/irrelevant responsibilities which in long term will increase the stress and dilute the knowledge/skill-set. Promotions and hikes are very irregular every year to the extent it frustrates all the employees. Of late, the company was fined for manipulating tax and fired many of its employees without any valid reasons which increase the fear of job security across all the other employees. The management brings a lot of initiatives frequently, but it barely makes any difference to the employees at the bottom of the organization pyramid. Work from home is not encouraged even once every week, which in this era is very retro.",Work on promotion and hike cycle to make it standard.,4,Current Employee,Associate Projects,Chennai,3,4,5,2,3

28-Sep-19,Flexible Benefit Plan. Even that is a sham!,"1. Hiring based on pipeline with no backup plan: Whenever Cognizant bids for any project, the market team and at times the vertical teams would start putting pressure on the delivery team to start lining up resources. So the delivery team reaches out to the work force management team for lining up resources and more often than not hear the answer that there are no available resources on the bench. So the obvious option left is to go out into the market and hire people. Now what happens to the resources recruited from the market if Cognizant doesn’t win the deal? They move to bench, which is kind of unfair for someone who has recently joined the company. This is an area I believe where all the companies in the IT Service industry have issues with. Unless someone can come up with an innovative solution for this problem, the companies belonging to this industry will always have to fire people every few years. In a different perspective it is the greed to grow and the tendency to bid for each and every opportunity available in the market without checking the internal ability to deliver and availability of proper resources that has led to this situation.

2. Plan for a particular resource pyramid and deliver with a much higher pyramid: Like for example during the bidding stage for acquiring a project, a plan is made to deliver the project with let’s say 5 senior level people and 15 junior level people to attain a particular percentage of profitability. But when the project starts more than 90% of the time the pyramid is not maintained, the project gets delivered with 10 senior level people and 10 junior level people, thus eating into the profitability. But this is not the end, one year down the line after the delivery starts senior level people wake up and take notice of this and try to optimize by releasing the senior level resources and bringing in freshers, leading to delivery issues. The standard dialogue of senior management is “we don’t want delivery issues, but at the same time want resource optimization to happen to increase the profitability”. It all falls on the delivery manager to maintain a fine balance between giving back big profits to the company and at the same time not create any delivery issues. The delivery manager has to have some sort of magical powers to achieve this kind of ideal situation. I have so far seen no delivery manager who is a magician.

3. Hiring at very senior levels from other companies: More often than not people from very senior management level are hired from other companies and made to sit at department head level. Obviously they come in with their own experience and achievements from the other companies and immediately try to implement their own process and procedures to showcase their worth to their bosses. This results in dissatisfaction among the lower levels. These people do not understand the ground level realities and also do not understand the technicalities, all they understand is implementation of the process which worked in their previous company. Who would make them understand that what worked in their previous company might not work here, as every company is fundamentally different? Anybody who has the courage to walk up to him and explain this, is sure to get a mouthful from him and is also sure to face his wrath going forward. These people are given supreme power as department head, without mentioning the big egos they come with.

4. The external army that comes along with the senior level people: More often than not, when a senior level person is hired from another company, they also slowly bring in their followers and yes-man’s from his previous company. The reason behind this is something which we have been reading in history for years. When a new king is made he plants spies in different places so that the king can get information of anything that is going on behind him. I feel the reason is same here. More often than not these loyal followers are also hired at some senior level as a reward for being loyal to the king over the past years. But the problem starts when these loyal followers try bossing over the loyal employees of the company. Obviously this doesn’t go well and more often than not results in dissatisfaction among the employees.

5. Now obviously I am not against hiring senior level people within a company, as I truly believe heterogeneous culture needs to be built with the genes of a company for achieving greatness. But the problem is no loyal employee or a loyal person would want someone hired and made to sit on his head overnight who has no idea about the DNA of the company. Hire high level executives and induct them into the system, make them understand DNA of a company, evaluate their progress and then give them responsibility and targets. Also don’t allow them to bring in their own army instead groom internal talent so that there is an ideal mix of external and internal culture in the department.

6. Egos are more important than good work: I hate to say this, but this is truth as I have faced this multiple times. You are doing good work and delivering good for the company, but if it hurts the ego of a senior level person, you will be sidelined. It is no different than a government office where you will be transferred to an unimportant post if you hurt the ego of political leader. There will be no discussion, just an organizational change and you will be shifted. At the end of the day they do not realize the looser is going to be the company.

7. For every couple of workers there are at least 4 brokers: These brokers come in all shapes, sizes and across locations and available especially at onsite. Their only work is to take the work done from the people on the ground showcase it to the client or internal management in a way as if without them this work would not have been possible or they have personally done this work. They do not care about their teams on the ground, they are only concerned about their personal year-end appraisals and how much bonus they can earn. As more often than not, these brokers are mid-level management or at least manager level people, the workers on the ground feel afraid to take them on and bring the truth in front of the world. These brokers call themselves project leads or delivery managers and can be seen across all types of projects. Not only they try to gain recognition for work which they have not done, they also exploit their project team members from time to time in various ways. These people will always be a shield between their ground level team members and the client or the internal senior management for each and every issue, as if the ground level people cannot speak. The brokers at onsite are even worse, they will try to win the confidence of the client by hook or crook and remain at onsite forever. Even if someone tries to replace them they will get the client into play and no one can touch them thereafter. Everyone knows across the company knows this, but no one takes any action in order not to dissatisfy the client.

8. Training and Care for Employees: Yes, there are training scheduled, but for good technical training the project has to take the cost, otherwise most of the trainings are worthless and sheer waste of time. There is a program within the company for building the career of an employee from a low level to a higher level, but if anyone talks to any employee who is undergoing this program the feedback would be appalling. Someone sitting higher up introduced this program and lot of money and effort is put behind it, but there has been no initiative to gather the actual benefits of this program, which is none. Only for the fear of not getting promoted to the next level, employees complete the program under pressure. Now talking about employee care, for the past couple of years astonishingly it has degraded like anything. People are being made to join in huge numbers every month, but only plan to nurture them and make them grow is a career architecture which is lack-luster program as discussed above. The moto here is to somehow earn the dollar, don’t care about the people or their career.

9. No formal bottom-up feedback process: There exists a appraisal process where managers can pass on their feedback to their reportees and rate them on their perception but there is no bottom up approach where the reportees rate their managers. Managers hold supreme power and based on their likes and dislikes they rate people and decide their fate. I do understand that there is no perfect appraisal process that exists in this world, but rating someone just based on perception is also not a good way. A near perfect appraisal process could be getting feedback from the client, the employee peers along with the employee manager. But this never happens resulting in disappointment for the employees. There are cases where client has rated an employee highly but due to the employee's relation with his boss the employee has been given a poor rating. Lastly there should be a process where the employee should also be able to pass on anonymous feedback about his manager or report any grudge he is holding to someone or some committee which should be able to take action based on the merit of the case. Someone needs to understand that this is a people driven industry and keeping people happy and addressing people issues should be of prime importance. Right now people are just too terrified to pass feedback against someone higher up as there have been numerous cases where the employee reporting the issue has landed up at the receiving end due to the supreme power of the seniors.

10. Margin and Revenue story: Revenue is something which comes from projects and margin is the profit margin on which projects are executed. The business development team has revenue targets and the project delivery team has margin targets. So the story goes like this. The business development team in order to win projects and to meet their targets will bid for projects at low margins, as it is a competitive market. There has been instances where deals have been signed with high revenue but with low margins even under 10% or at minus margins. The business development guy meets his target by winning such projects and assuring revenue in-flow for the company. Now once the project is won the pressure falls on the delivery team to improve the margin and at times unrealistic margin targets are set based on the whims and wills of someone senior. Like for example a target is set for a project to achieve a margin of 30% which has been signed at 10% or less. The delivery team is not a magician to achieve such impossible targets and they resort to different ways to achieve their target like bringing in Automation and replacing high cost senior and experienced resources with junior people. Now Automation is a separate story altogether which is fed to the senior management and also to the client in a nice wrapper showcasing 80% of the work that is done manually could be automated. No one gets deeper into the details weather it is actually possible or not and asks the question as to whether automation which is kind of buzz-word in the industry currently is atall mature enough to replace human beings? Everybody is just happy with the fact that if 80% automation can be achieved then I can release atleast 8 employees out of a 10 members team, resulting in huge savings. No question is asked where will those 8 employees go?

11. Reporting and calls all day: If you happen to reach a certain level in terms of designation, you are expected to attend to calls and make reports only for senior management. Evenif you want to develop yourself technically, opportunities will be few and at the end of the day your appraisal results will be hurt, as no one wants to hear what you have achieved technically. Only story they want to hear is how much your project has made and with what margin? How many open positions have you fulfilled which has brought in revenue for the company? While keeping track of revenue, margin and fulfillment of positions is important, but those would be automatically taken care-off if the quality of delivery improves and you have a happy client. There is also a particular species in Cognizant who call themselves as Solution Architects and I regret saying this that apart from a selected few, the architects in Cognizant no way compare with the architects from other companies like an IBM or an Accenture. I have spoken to my friends in other companies who as architects and when asked about the architects from Cognizant, they just give a quiet smile. Cognizant solution architects are good in designing resource pyramids without a plan on how to achieve them. The bottom-line remains that excellence in quality of resources and also the drive to achieve that excellence from the senior management is missing. A company which only focuses on revenue and margin only without focusing on quality of it’s core products which is people in this case would definitely meet this kind of storm every few years.

12. Location theory: There is a theory in Cognizant that every project that comes in should be operated out of Chennai. If the project is of a few million dollars then the location strategy is decided at a very high level and obviously it is Chennai. It basically depends on where the big people are located, as most of the big people are located in Chennai, most of the projects are operated out of Chennai. No one understands, that whether a project is executed out of Chennai, Bangalore, Pune or Gurugram eventually the revenue and profit is for Cognizant and judicious choice should be made to avoid risk by concentrating everything in Chennai only.

13. Bad Treatment of employees by Managers and above: This has started over the last few years as there is no anonymous bottom-up feedback process. Even if some employee dares to take up the cases with the HR Team, action on managers and above are rare. Employees are threatened more often than not and are made to deliver as per the wish of the delivery managers. Genuine employee issues are ignored. Employees are given mouthful for each and every small or big issue. Employee career growth opportunities are ignored. Only people who are good at oiling and buttering get their wishes granted and get good results in their appraisal. No one cares for good work and perfect delivery, it is all about oiling and buttering your manager and getting a higher bucket at the end of the year.

14. Unhealthy Environment: People in this company know how to be selfish. Ohh!! Sorry I used the wrong word. People in this company know how to be extremely selfish. They can beg, borrow or even steal to meet their target. They do not think what will be the implications of their action on others. On top of this if you have the blessings from any top leader of the company then no one can touch even a manager level person. He can go on doing whatever he wishes to. He can select projects he wants to get into, he can ask his subordinates to pick his son from the school, he can threaten people and what not. At the end of the day he also gets a high rating in his appraisal, just because someone at the top is there with all his blessings showered on this sick soul. Just a quick scan across the company in an unbiased manner would give anyone who wants to bring the company on the right track would reveal this picture. There is no respect for a low level employee, they are being treated like some daily laborer daily.

15. No one wants to hear “No”: If you want to work in this company, you should learn not to say “No”. They want “Yes” for all questions. If you say “No” to anything, people will go to your boss and bring a “Yes” from him. If your boss also says “No” then they will go to his boss to bring a “Yes”. This simple game is called “If you hear a No, escalated and get a Yes”. This I believe is one of the reasons that the company is seeing such bad days now. There is no respect for people saying “No” and everybody is bringing in growth for the company, and you should say “yes” always to that growth. They will dangle a carrot in front of you and get a “yes” from either you, or your boss or his boss.

They will put you on the bench for two months while the HR's do absolutely nothing to help you find a project and might end up asking you to leave. Never get any onsite opportunities or even be allowed to change the role to something better. If you think reporting a senior for bad behaviour will do something, guess again. Nothing. Instead you will be penalised for even daring to speak up. Work culture: it is the worst part of this company. If you are smart and efficient, you will get more work and ask to slow down. Your quality work will never earn you any brownie points. The manager will always say that they are there to help you. Be warned. It's a trap. Anything you say in confidence will be used against you. If they are offering you a good package, I would suggest you to stay for a year and then find a good company before your career is ruined. They will give you rubbish work and during rating discussion ask you why didn't you innovate. Salary increment: non existent. You won't even realise that you got a hike. Unprofessional leads and managers. It will bring tears to your eyes if you see how well they write an email, yet they are the one's who will tell you that your communication is lacking. It is not a place for personal aspirations. They throw those words at you, but won't let you learn anything new, because it is not a part of the project requirement. Of course whether you have work or not, you have to stay in office for 9 to 10 hours doing nothing, but pretending to work by staring at your monitor.
